About
=====

This is a publically accessable git repository where I am posting all my
generic and most of the time poorly written scrupts.

Anything you choose to use from this repo should be done at your own risk.
The scripts are meant to work for me so there is little testing with 
configrations that are not mine.

Current Files 
=============
backup.sh - simple migration script for dev boxes, moves user information and home directories

blacklist.sh - IPtables blacklist, creates new chain called blacklist and adds lots of ASPAC ips

dupfiles.pl - checksums files and identifies possible duplicates

todo.txt - list of addtional scripts and modifications to be done to the current batch

vimsetup.sh - script to configure vim more to my taste, uncludes vunble, and the gpg script
