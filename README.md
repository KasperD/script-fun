Script-fun is the location I am making all my poorly written scripts accessible 
for the world to see. This will be a mix of bash, perl, python scripts to do a 
very random assortment of things.

Anything you choose to run in this repository should be done at your own risk. 
These scripts were only ever tested on the systems I needed so additional 
testing on alternate configurations were never done.
